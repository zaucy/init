# Zaucy's Init Script(s)

I re-install my operating system(s) often. I use these scripts to get my machine up and running quickly how I like it. It is highly opinionated and I would not recommend running it.

## Windows

```batch
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zaucy/init/main/init.bat" > init.bat && .\init.bat
```
