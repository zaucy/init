# Zaucy's Init Script(s)

I re-install my operating system(s) often. I use these scripts to get my machine up and running quickly how I like it. It is highly opinionated and I would not recommend running it.

## Windows

```sh
curl zau.cy/init.cmd -L | cmd
```

## Unix

```sh
curl zau.cy/init.sh -L | sh
```
