# Zaucy's Twitch Stream

I stream my open source work on Ecsact occasionally and sometimes just for fun.

## Ideas

Things I'm thinking of doing on stream for fun.

 - [ ] Tree sitter for [docopt](http://docopt.org/)
 - [ ] LSP for [docopt](http://docopt.org/)
 - [ ] Code generator for [docopt](http://docopt.org/)
 - [ ] Full [Ecsact](https://ecsact.dev) example written in rust
 - [ ] Refactor `:TypeAnim` for more interesting animations and configurations
